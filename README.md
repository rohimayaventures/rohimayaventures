## 🚀 Featured Products (That I Actually Developed and Preparing to Ship)

### 1. **EclipseLink AI (R&D)** - Clinical Handoff Intelligence Platform
**The Problem:** Nurses and clinical specialists spend a minimum of 3-5 minutes per patient on shift handoffs. For 6 patients, that's 30 minutes of sacred time stolen every shift and that much extra time facilities have to pay.

**My Solution:** Voice-first AI that generates comprehensive SBAR handoffs in 30-45 seconds.

**Impact:**
- ⚡ **80% time reduction** (3 minutes →  30 seconds)
- 🏥 **3 hospital pilots** secured for 2026 deployment
- 🎯 **15 clinical roles** supported (RN, LPN, CNA, RT, PT, OT, etc.)
- 💰 **$1.2M annual savings** per 100-bed facility

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, OpenAI Whisper, Claude AI, FHIR integration, HIPAA-compliant architecture

**Status:** 🔥 R&D, pilot program launching Q1 2026

---

### 2. **StaffingForecast.io (Protoype)** - Workforce Management & Time Tracking
**The Problem:** Small businesses waste 15+ hours/week on manual scheduling, time-off requests, and payroll reconciliation.

**My Solution:** AI-powered staffing platform that predicts coverage needs and automates schedule optimization.

**Impact:**
- 💰 **60% reduction** in agency staffing costs
- ⚡ **$1.2M annual savings** for 130-person team
- 📊 **Real-time dashboards** for capacity planning
- ✅ **Automated compliance** tracking

**Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Stripe, Twilio

**Why This Matters for Product Roles:** I understand SMB pain points intimately—I built products solving time-off tracking, shift coverage, and compliance documentation because I've *managed* these workflows myself.

---

### 3. **Clinical Triage Dashboard (Protoype)** - Emergency Department Intelligence
**The Problem:** ED nurses juggle 8-12 patients with scattered information across multiple systems.

**My Solution:** Real-time dashboard aggregating vitals, labs, orders, and acuity scores in one view.

**Impact:**
- ⏱️ **40% faster** clinical decision-making
- 🎯 **85% user adoption** within 2 weeks
- 🏆 **"Finally, a tool built by someone who gets it"** - Charge Nurse feedback

**Tech Stack:** React, D3.js, WebSocket real-time updates, FHIR API

**Product Insight:** Designed by someone who's actually worked ED shifts—I understand the users because I *was* the user.

---

### 4. **HealthLiteracy.ai (Protoype)** - Patient Education Generator
**The Problem:** Clinical staff spend 20+ minutes creating discharge instructions patients can't understand.

**My Solution:** AI that converts medical jargon into patient-friendly instructions at appropriate reading levels.

**Impact:**
- 📚 **3rd-8th grade** reading level translations
- 🌍 **50+ languages** supported
- ⚡ **90% time savings** for patient education
- 📈 **Improved comprehension** scores

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, PDF generation

## 💡 My Product Philosophy

### User-Centered Healthcare Technology
I believe the best healthcare products are built by people who've actually lived the workflows. I don't design for nurses or healthcare specialists alone—I design *as* a nurse who became a product leader.

### Ship Fast, Iterate Faster
- **Prototype in weeks-months**, not years
- **User feedback** drives every iteration
- **Data-driven decisions** over opinions
- **Ship 80% solutions** that users love over 100% solutions nobody uses

### AI as Augmentation, Not Replacement
Healthcare needs AI that **amplifies** clinical expertise, not replaces it. My products and prototypes put clinicians in control while automating the tedious work they shouldn't be stressed about when the patients should be the focus.

### Bridge Builder
I translate between three languages most people only speak one of:
- **Clinical** (the workflows, the pain points, the regulations)
- **Technical** (the architecture, the APIs, the code)
- **Business** (the ROI, the market, the strategy)
